description: Generate a standup update from recent activity. Use when preparing for daily standup, summarizing yesterday's commits and PRs and ticket moves, formatting work into yesterday/today/blockers, or structuring a few rough notes into a shareable update.

# /standup

Generate a standup update by pulling together recent activity across your tools.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        STANDUP                                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  STANDALONE (always works)                                       │
│  ✓ Tell me what you worked on and I'll structure it             │
│  ✓ Format for daily standup (yesterday / today / blockers)      │
│  ✓ Keep it concise and action-oriented                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## What I Need From You

Tell me what you worked on:
"Worked on the auth migration, reviewed 3 PRs, got blocked on the API rate limiting issue."

## Output

```markdown
## Standup — [Date]

### Yesterday
- [Completed item with ticket reference if available]
- [Completed item]

### Today
- [Planned item with ticket reference]
- [Planned item]

### Blockers
- [Blocker with context and who can help]
```

## Tips

1. **Run it every morning** — Build a habit and never scramble for standup notes.
2. **Add context** — After I generate, add any nuance about blockers or priorities.
3. **Share format** — Ask me to format for Slack, email, or your team's standup tool.
